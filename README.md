# Happier-Passengers

Competition on passenger satisfaction is one of the many dimensions in which airlines compete. 
Based on this, how could an airline approach the question of increasing passenger satisfaction given its finite resources? 

In order to achieve this, one approach is to: 
(a) quantify and rank the impact of various factors of flight quality on passenger satisfaction, and 
(b) based on this ranking, analyze how the flight process could be tailored to maximize passenger satisfaction in a cost-effective manner. 

The scope of this project is to implement only the first part of the above approach: statistically quantify and rank the factors that impact passenger satisfaction and forward the analysis to relevant parties with suggestions.

In terms of implementation, given a dataset of airline passenger surveys, I will first create a model of customer satisfaction [target variable] via decision trees and then perform a sensitivity analysis on factors of flight quality.
